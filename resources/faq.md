# üí¨ FAQ

## <mark style="color:blue;">All That Node/ NODE SERVICE</mark>

### üßê  What is All That Node?

**All That Node** is a node-as-a-service powered by [DSRV](https://www.dsrvlabs.com/), a leading validator and blockchain infrastructure provider based in Seoul, South Korea. **All That Node** can help you launch and manage a custom node, eliminating the hassle of node management.



### üì¶  What protocols does All That Node support?

We currently support Ethereum, Terra, and Osmosis, with many more to come_!_&#x20;



### üåê  How do HA (high-availability) clusters work?

Our HA clusters rely on three essential components.&#x20;

1. **24/7 enterprise-grade monitoring system** that keeps an eye on nodes to make sure they are functioning properly.
2. **Load balancer** that automatically distributes requests among servers based on geolocation, allowing faster access to the node API.
3. **Failover system** connected to the load balancer, which can take over immediately to ensure your service remains operational.



## <mark style="color:blue;">PROJECT/ REQUESTS</mark>



### üìÇ  How can I create a new project?

After signing in, select "Create New Project" in the upper right-hand corner. Then complete the following three steps.

1. Select the protocol you wish to use.
2. Select the plan suitable for your needs. We currently offer the RPC Free and Custom Plan only.
3. Be sure to name your project!

Once you‚Äôve completed the above, you will be redirected to the Project Detail Page. Your project is now ready to go!



### üìÇ  How many projects can I create?

It depends on your plan. With the RPC Node Free Plan, you can create one project per protocol. If you wish to create more projects per protocol, you can do so with the Custom Plan.

#### &#x20;    üí°  _**To learn more about plans, click** _ [_here_](faq.md#what-are-the-options-for-plans)__



### üìà  How many requests can I call?

Once again, this depends on the plan you pick. See the table below to compare different plans.

| #                | RPC Node Free | RPC Node Dedicated | Archive Node |     Custom    |
| ---------------- | ------------: | -----------------: | -----------: | :-----------: |
| Requests per day |        10,000 |            100,000 |      100,000 | **Unlimited** |

### üìà  How can I check the number of requests left?

To make things easier for you, we keep track of your requests.&#x20;

You can check the remaining number on the Project Detail Page (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).



## <mark style="color:blue;">API/ END-POINT KEY</mark>

### üîë What is an API key used for?

API stands for 'Application Programming Interface'. An API key is a set of programming instructions or code used to identify and authenticate an application or user. An API key is generated by the platform, which then calls the API in order to identify the user, developer, or program attempting to access the node (or blockchain). API keys can help break development silos, and are typically accompanied by a set of access rights belonging to the API associated with the key.



### üîë  How can I get an API key?

API keys can only be obtained by creating a project. If you have questions about creating a new project, click [_**here**_](faq.md#how-can-i-create-a-new-project).



### üîë  How can I find my API key?

There are two ways to view your API key.

1. When creating a new project, you will be redirected to the project detail page. You can find the API key clusters below the project name.
2. If you have already created your project, go to the Dashboard menu and select the project whose API keys you want. You can find the API key clusters below the project name.
