# Moonbeam

_The first Ethereum-compatible parachain to be fully up and running on Polkadot, Moonbeam is optimized for scalability and cross-chain functionality._



For more information on Moonbeam APIs, see the [official documentation](https://docs.moonbeam.network/).

## Moonbeam RPC Endpoints  <a href="#network" id="network"></a>

#### Mainnet

* `https://moonbeam-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com:9933/'YOUR-API-KEY'`

#### Alphanet

* `https://moonbeam-alphanet-rpc.allthatnode.com:9933/'YOUR-API-KEY'`



Find `'YOUR-API-KEY'` by going to the **** [_**Dashboard**_](https://www.allthatnode.com/dashboard.dsrv) **** menu (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).

{% hint style="info" %}
Or you can use the public Moonbeam nodes without the API key. \
_(i.e._ `https://moonbeam-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com:9933/`_)_

But Public endpoints are not intended for DApp building. Please use private / dedicated RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs, etc.
