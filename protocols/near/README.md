# NEAR

_NEAR is a fast and developer-friendly PoS blockchain, which acts as a community-run cloud platform and is characterized by an innovative sharding mechanism, Nightshade._



For more information on NEAR APIs, see the [official documentation](https://docs.near.org/docs/api/overview).

## NEAR RPC Endpoints  <a href="#network" id="network"></a>

#### Mainnet

* `https://near-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com:3030/'YOUR-API-KEY'`

#### Testnet

* `https://near-testnet-rpc.allthatnode.com:3030/'YOUR-API-KEY'`



Find `'YOUR-API-KEY'` by going to the **** [_**Dashboard**_](https://www.allthatnode.com/dashboard.dsrv) **** menu (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).

{% hint style="info" %}
Or you can use the public NEAR nodes without the API key. \
_(i.e._ `https://near-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com:3030/`_)_

But Public endpoints are not intended for DApp building. Please use private / dedicated RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs, etc.
