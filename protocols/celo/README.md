# Celo

_Celo is a mobile-first PoS blockchain that enables anyone with a mobile phone to access DeFi services and tools, promoting an efficient global ecosystem built around inclusivity and sustainability._



For more information on Celo APIs, see the [official documentation](https://docs.celo.org/).

## Celo RPC Endpoints  <a href="#network" id="network"></a>

#### Mainnet

* `https://celo-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`

#### Alfajores

* `https://celo-alfajores-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`

#### Baklava

* `https://celo-baklava-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`



Find `'YOUR-API-KEY'` by going to the **** [_**Dashboard**_](https://www.allthatnode.com/dashboard.dsrv) **** menu (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).

{% hint style="info" %}
Or you can use the public Celo nodes without the API key. \
_(i.e._ `https://celo-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/`_)_

But Public endpoints are not intended for DApp building. Please use private / dedicated RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs, etc.
