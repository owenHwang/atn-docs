# Avalanche

_Avalanche is a fast, smart contract platform built to power a scalable ecosystem of decentralized applications with exceptional transaction finality and low costs._



For more information on Avalanche APIs, see the [official documentation](https://docs.avax.network/).

## Avalanche RPC Endpoints

#### Mainnet

* `https://avalanche-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`

#### Testnet

* `https://avalanche-testnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`



Find `'YOUR-API-KEY'` by going to the **** [_**Dashboard**_](https://www.allthatnode.com/dashboard.dsrv) **** menu (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).

{% hint style="info" %}
Or you can use the public Avalanche nodes without the API key. \
_(i.e._ `https://avalanche-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/`_)_

But Public endpoints are not intended for DApp building. Please use private / dedicated RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs, etc.
{% endhint %}
