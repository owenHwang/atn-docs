# Solana

_An industry leader in terms of speed and ecosystem growth, Solana boasts over 400 projects including NFT marketplaces, decentralized apps, and more._

For more information on Solana APIs, see the [official documentation](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api).

## Solana RPC Endpoints

#### Mainnet

* `https://solana-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`

#### Devnet

* `https://solana-devnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`



Find `'YOUR-API-KEY'` by going to the **** [_**Dashboard**_](https://www.allthatnode.com/dashboard.dsrv) **** menu (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).

{% hint style="info" %}
Or you can use the public Solana nodes without the API key. \
_(i.e._ `https://solana-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/`_)_

But Public endpoints are not intended for DApp building. Please use private / dedicated RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs, etc.
{% endhint %}
