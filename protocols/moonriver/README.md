## Moonriver RPC Endpoints  <a href="#network" id="network"></a>

#### Mainnet

* `https://moonriver-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com:9933/'YOUR-API-KEY'`



Find `'YOUR-API-KEY'` by going to the **** [_**Dashboard**_](https://www.allthatnode.com/dashboard.dsrv) **** menu (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).

{% hint style="info" %}
Or you can use the public Moonriver nodes without the API key. \
_(i.e._ `https://moonriver-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com:9933/`_)_

But Public endpoints are not intended for DApp building. Please use private / dedicated RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs, etc.
