# Fantom

_Fantom is a_ highly scalable, modular and fast smart contract platform secured by Lachesis, a unique aBFT consensus mechanism.



For more information on Fantom APIs, see the [official documentation](https://docs.fantom.foundation/).

## Fantom RPC Endpoints  <a href="#network" id="network"></a>

#### Mainnet

* `https://fantom-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`

#### Testnet

* `https://fantom-testnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`



Find `'YOUR-API-KEY'` by going to the **** [_**Dashboard**_](https://www.allthatnode.com/dashboard.dsrv) **** menu (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).

{% hint style="info" %}
Or you can use the public Fantom nodes without the API key. \
_(i.e._ `https://fantom-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/`_)_

But Public endpoints are not intended for DApp building. Please use private / dedicated RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs, etc.
{% endhint %}
