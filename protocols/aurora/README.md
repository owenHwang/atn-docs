# Aurora

_Aurora is an Ethereum Virtual Machine created by the team at the NEAR Protocol, delivering a turn-key solution for developers to operate their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable and future-safe platform, with low transaction costs for their users._



For more information on Avalanche APIs, see the [official documentation](https://doc.aurora.dev/).

## Aurora RPC Endpoints

#### Mainnet

* `https://aurora-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/'YOUR-API-KEY'`



Find `'YOUR-API-KEY'` by going to the **** [_**Dashboard**_](https://www.allthatnode.com/dashboard.dsrv) **** menu (Dashboard > All Projects > Project Detail Page).

{% hint style="info" %}
Or you can use the public Aurora nodes without the API key. \
_(i.e._ `https://aurora-mainnet-rpc.allthatnode.com/`_)_

But Public endpoints are not intended for DApp building. Please use private / dedicated RPC servers when you launch your application, drop NFTs, etc.
{% endhint %}
