# ðŸ¤” Why All That Node?

## Why Us?&#x20;

We provide the most diverse selection of protocols, a set of ready-to-use sample codes, and increased efficiency thanks to geolocation routing. Streamlined, state-of-the-art, and built for the community.



## How is All That Node different?&#x20;

**All That Node** supports 20+ leading protocols, because we understand the growing importance of multi-chain functionality. And our RPC Node Free Plan provides all this for free, because we understand the responsibility of supporting developers.



## Why use All That Node instead of running your own node?&#x20;

While running your own node has its benefits, it can come with some pain points as well. Think expensive maintenance, engineering resources, scaling, the occasional bug and more. Sound familiar? With **All That Node**, we take care of your node for you.
